PHP compare databases
=====================

A script to determine if 2 mySQL Databases, called 'Development' and 'Live' have the same tables and table structures.

It will create tables in the Live database if they do not exist.

It can determine in a very basic way if there are tables of the same name on the Development and Live database that have differences in their structure and need to be updated.
